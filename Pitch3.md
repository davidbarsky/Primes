1. What did you do?

I worked on a numbers-based pattern matching game called Primes. I wanted to make a small, focused game that can be played for a minute here, a minute there.

2. What did you learn?

I learned about advanced object-oriented programming — delegates, observers, etc. I've never had the opportunity to implement something like this in my computer science classes.

3. What did you learn about yourself?

That I really like writing algorithms. I always thought that I'd be frustrated by them, but I was surprised of how much intellectual fulfillment I get from writing an algorithm.

4. How have you changed?

I guess I became more mature? I mean, at this age, that's bound to happen anyways, but I feel like it was pretty heavily accelerated during my time at MGWU.

5. What problem did you face and how did you overcome/solve it?

The issues that I had to overcome aren't directly related to programing, but it's more of a general personal problem. Basically, I learned how and when to say "no" to additional features. It sincerely helped me become better at managing complex, large projects.

6. What did you have to figure out in order to implement a specific feature?

As I said earlier, I had to learn about more advanced object-oriented programming. It opened a new (not so much new — a better word would be *expansion*).
